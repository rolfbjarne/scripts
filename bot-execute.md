# bot-execute.sh

This is a script that is helpful in a few scenarios:

* Run a command on multiple bots. Typical examples:
    * Get the available disk space for all bots.
    * List all the Xcodes each bot has installed.
    * Run a test on all the various macOS versions we support.
* Run a test on a particular bot.
